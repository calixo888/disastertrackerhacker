Welcome!

Natural Disaster Tracker Hacker is an accurate, highly-functional projective application that 
processes vast aggregates of historical data to produce models governing natural disaster risk 
of the user's location. Our models rely on heavily-layered regression simulations, trained 
rigorously on tens of thousands of historical data entries pertaining to hurricanes, forest fires, 
and droughts with a 98% reliablity figure. 

The ramifications of climate change are evident in the increasingly frequent and drastic natural
disasters occuring annually. Virtually every citizen of the world can benefit from this application,
as no one is immune to the effects of climate change and it is imperative to the livelihood of many to
understand the natural disaster risk of their region. Though there is an abundunce of historical data
regarding natural disasters accessible by the public, until now there has not be an all-encompassing 
application that has honed these resources into a clean probability calculator. 

Natural Disaster Tracker Hacker can be found on https://disastertrackerhacker.herokuapp.com/ as a 
free web-based application. This product may be commercialized as a risk assesment service, such 
as those in the agriculture sector or for real estate insurance entities. In a similar vein, further 
investments will allow us to enhance our promotional efforts as well as expand our modeling to more
niche metrics centered on meteorological or even economic data. The Natural Disaster Tracker Hacker 
has enourmous potential not only the private consumer base sector but in the massive, established 
industries of crude oil, agriculture, natural resources, and real estate.
