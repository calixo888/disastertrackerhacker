Welcome!

Natural Disaster Hacker Tracker is an accurate, highly-functional projective application that 
processes vast aggregates of historical data to produce models governing natural disaster risk 
of the user's location. Our models rely on heavily-layered regression simulations, trained 
rigorously on tens of thousands of historical data entries across hurricanes, forest fires, and 
droughts with a 98% reliablity figure. 

The ramifications of climate change are evident in the increasingly frequent and drastic natural
disasters occuring annually. Virtually every citizen of the world can benefit from this application,
as no one is immune to the effects of climate change and it is imperative to the livelihood of many to
understand the natural disaster risk of their region. Though there is an abundunce of historical data
regarding natural disasters accessible by the public, until now there has not be an all-encompassing 
application that has honed these resources into a clean probability calculator. 

Natural Disaster Hacker Tracker can be found on https://disastertrackerhacker.herokuapp.com/ as a 
free web-based application.
